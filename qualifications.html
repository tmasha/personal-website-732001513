            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <h2>Computer Graphics</h2>
            <p>Computer Graphics is my main interest within the field of computer science. As someone who has always enjoyed beautiful sights, whether on a hike in a national park or watching animated space documentaries on TV, visualization has always fascinated me more than anything.</p>
            <h2>Computational Physics</h2>
            <p>I am fascinated in how computers can simulate realistic physical environments. Specifically, simulating interstellar environments fascinates me.</p>
            <h2>ML/AI</h2>
            <p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are currently booming. I am interested in learning more about how professionals are attempting to replicate human thinking with computer power.</p>
            <h2>Game Development</h2>
            <p>I have been playing video games for years, and naturally, as someone obsessed with computer graphics, I am hoping to be accepted into the game development minor to further my skills in Visualization.</p>
            <h2>Data Science</h2>
            <p>Every project relies on efficient data analysis to store data in ways that make programs easier to use. Thus, I am interested in learning more about it.</p>
