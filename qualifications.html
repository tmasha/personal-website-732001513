        <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
        <p>Listed below are all the programming languages that I have at least some sort of experience in!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="left">
        <h1><a href="https://isocpp.org/">C++</a></h1>
        <p>C++ is the language that I have the most experience in.
            Throughout my time at Texas A&M, most of my courses mainly have worked with C++, including my introduction
            to Data Structures and Algorithms.
            Now, I prefer to program in C++, as I have used it for programming with data structures, servers, and
            computer graphics.
            I appreciate C++ for its sheer speed, its ability to work with pointers, its object-oriented programming
            capabilities, and its syntax not being too difficult to understand.
        </p>

    <div class="right">
        <h1><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></h1>
        <p>I have extensive Python experience, as I have used it in several different projects.
            I have tutored 8 different Texas A&M engineering freshmen in ENGR 102: Engineering Computation, which is an
            introductory course to Python and programming logic.
            For my undergraduate research with Aggienova, I use <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> and an
            <a href="https://www.swift.psu.edu/too_api/">API</a> to add entries to, gather information for, and
            de-duplicate a database.
            For many lab reports and other projects, I have used NumPy and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize data in
            graphs.
            I touched on scikit-learn when I was working on a machine learning project for the tidaltamu hackathon.

    <div class="left">
        <h1><a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">Java</a></h1>
        <p>Java was the first programming language I ever learned back in high school
            when I enrolled in <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a">AP Computer
                Science A</a>.
            My largest Java project is my final project for CSCE 314: Programming Languages, where I attempted to
            develop a clone
            of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">New York Times's Wordle</a> as a <a
                href="https://openjfx.io/">JavaFX</a> project.
            However, I have been LeetCoding in it frequently to ensure that I am still proficient in it.
            Java is great for UI development and whenever you don't want to work with pointers.

        <p>This website that you are currently looking at and enjoying the breathtaking view of is pure JavaScript,
            HTML, and CSS.
            JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are the classic trio for web development, and I have familiarized myself with them
            through several projects.
            I worked on front-end development for the first time ever with the Virtual eSports Coach project as a
            freshman, where I created a modern UI using React.
            Furthermore, my introduction to graphics programming was through <a
                href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>, which I used to create my very
            first Solar System simulation.
            Now, I am more experienced with creating web applications, and people often ask me to help them create their
            websites.

        <h1><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a></h1>
        <p>I have a small amount of experience with C#, as I worked with <a
                href="https://unity.com/how-to/programming-unity">Unity C#'s scriptable objects</a>
            when I was working on my entry for the Chillenium game jam.

        <p>Though I have not worked on any Rust projects,
            I am working on familiarizing myself with the Rust language, as it is starting to become more common in this
            day and
            age where <a

    <!-- INTERESTS -->

    <div class=" center">
        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <p>These are some of my interests within the world of computer science.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="left">
        <h1>Computer Graphics</h1>
        <p>Computer Graphics is my main interest within the field of computer science. As someone who has always enjoyed
            beautiful sights, whether on a hike in a national park or watching animated space documentaries on TV,
            visualization has always fascinated me more than anything. When I get a job, I am hoping that I can work
            with graphics in some way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="right">
        <h1>ML/AI</h1>
        <p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are two rapidly growing fields, as the world is currently
            undergoing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_boom">AI boom.</a>
            Various applications of AI have been experiencing rapid growth, such as natural language processing,
            computer vision, and autonomous systems.
            In a world where AI is advancing so quickly, I have a desire to understand more about how it works and its
            applications.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="left">
        <h1>Data Science</h1>
        <p>If not the most important field of computer science, I think that data science is one of the most important
            fields because for almost every type of project you can name, you need data. This
            data needs to be organized, analyzed, and applied properly. Throughout most of my projects, I have had to
            implement
            data management somehow, whether it be in a database or in a file. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="right">
        <h1>Game Development</h1>
        <p>Game Development is a new interest of mine. I first explored it last March when I went to the <a
                href="https://chillennium.itch.io/">Chillenium</a> game jam
            with 3 of my friends, where we teamed up to rapidly design a 2D dungeon crawler game in 48 hours.
            After having a blast at this experience and exploring computer graphics more, I am now hoping to minor
            in Game Development here at Texas A&M University.
