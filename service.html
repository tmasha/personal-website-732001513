        <h1>Service</h1>
        <p>I have served my community in various ways. As an A&M student, I have tutored various students for
            programming and calculus courses. This spring semester, I will be a TA for CSCE 221: Data Structures and
            Algorithms, where I will put in the extra effort to make sure my students are equipped with the data
            structure knowledge they need to thrive in the indsutry. I have developed personal websites for friends and
            groups at no cost.</p>
